# games_of_chance

# This  was a cute little project suggested by Codecademy to write a few different functions that simulate games of chance. The suggested games of chance included flipping a coin, Cho Han (a game in which, essentially, one bets on whether the sum of two rolled dice will be even or odd), drawing a random card from a deck of cards, and roulette. The latter only implements a selection of the roulette betting rules, namely selecting a a particular number, whether the "ball" will land on an odd or even number, and whether the "ball" will land on a red slot or a black slot. 

# While the Codecademy prompt was to hard-code calls to the various games of chance, I made it so that the player could choose among the games of chance, could choose how many tokens to bet, and could choose whether to bet on odd/even, heads/tails, etc.

# In order to run this code, you'll need Python 3.8; the only packages called are the standard packages random and sys.
